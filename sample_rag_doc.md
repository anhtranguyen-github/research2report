# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval mechanisms. This approach enhances the capabilities of generative AI systems by allowing them to access and utilize relevant information from external knowledge bases.

## Key Components

### 1. Vector Database

The vector database stores document embeddings, which are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Popular vector databases include:

- Qdrant
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Milvus
- ChromaDB

### 2. Document Processing Pipeline

The document processing pipeline consists of:

- Document loading from various sources (PDFs, websites, databases)
- Text chunking (splitting documents into smaller, manageable pieces)
- Embedding generation (converting text chunks into vector representations)
- Vector storage (saving embeddings in the vector database)

### 3. Retrieval System

The retrieval system:

- Takes user queries and converts them to vector embeddings
- Performs vector similarity search to find relevant documents
- Ranks and filters results based on relevance scores
- Returns the most pertinent information for the generation step

### 4. Large Language Model (LLM)

The LLM:

- Receives the user query and retrieved context
- Generates coherent, contextually relevant responses
- Can be prompted to cite sources and explain reasoning
- Maintains conversational context across multiple turns

## Advanced RAG Techniques

### Query Transformation

- Enhancing original queries with additional context
- Query decomposition for complex questions
- Hypothetical document embeddings

### Re-ranking

- Using stronger but more computationally intensive models to re-rank initial results
- Applying cross-encoders after bi-encoders for more accurate relevance scoring
- Incorporating user feedback for relevance tuning

### Hybrid Search

- Combining vector similarity with keyword-based (BM25) search
- Metadata filtering based on document attributes
- Multi-modal retrieval (text, images, audio)

## Evaluation Methods

Effective RAG systems can be evaluated using:

- Retrieval precision and recall metrics
- Generation quality metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore)
- Human evaluation of faithfulness and relevance
- Hallucination detection benchmarks

## Challenges and Limitations

- Context window limitations of LLMs
- Balancing between retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency
- Handling of out-of-domain queries
- Data freshness and update frequency
- Attribution and citation accuracy
